    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to evaluate prompts against variety of model endpoints deployed on Azure AI Platform or non Azure AI platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide uses Python Class as an application target which is passed to Evaluate API provided by Azure AI Evaluation SDK to evaluate results generated by LLM models against provided prompts. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the following Azure AI services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [azure-ai-evaluation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/evaluate-sdk)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend 30 minutes running this sample. \n",
