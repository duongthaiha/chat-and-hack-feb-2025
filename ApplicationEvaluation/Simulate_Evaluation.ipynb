    "# Simulate and Evaluate using AI as Judge Quality Evaluators with Azure AI Evaluation SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to evaluate prompts against variety of model endpoints deployed on Azure AI Platform or non Azure AI platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide uses Python Class as an application target which is passed to Evaluate API provided by Azure AI Evaluation SDK to evaluate results generated by LLM models against provided prompts. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the following Azure AI services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [azure-ai-evaluation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/evaluate-sdk)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend 30 minutes running this sample. \n",

Use these principles to guide your AI development and deployment processes. Microsoft\\'s Responsible AI Standard was developed to operationalize their six AI principles, providing actionable guidance for product teams (Source: Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements-3.pdf).\\n\\n2. **Leverage Established Guidelines**: Follow established guidelines for human-AI interaction when designing AI systems. For example, Microsoft\\'s Responsible AI Standard recommends adhering to their \"Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction\" to ensure systems are designed with user needs and ethical considerations in mind (Source: Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements-3.pdf).\\n\\n3. **Use Interpretability Tools**: Employ tools like the InterpretML toolkit to understand the impact of features on system behavior. This can help stakeholders, such as developers and end-users, better understand model predictions and ensure transparency in AI systems (Source: Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements-3.pdf).\\n\\n4. **Conduct Contextual Evaluations**: Assign user researchers to define, design, and prioritize evaluations in realistic contexts of use. This ensures that AI systems are tested and refined in environments that closely resemble their intended real-world applications (Source: Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements-3.pdf).\\n\\n5. **Engage in Collaboration and Feedback**: Collaborate with industry, academia, civil society, and government to advance responsible AI practices. Microsoft emphasizes the importance of contributing to the global dialogue on responsible AI and learning from others\\' experiences (Source: Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements-3.pdf).\\n\\n6. **Iterate and Adapt**: Treat your Responsible AI framework as a living document. Continuously update it to reflect new research, technologies, laws, and lessons learned from implementation challenges (Source: Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements-3.pdf).\\n\\n### Examples and Best Practices:\\n- **Example 1: Transparency in AI Models**: Use interpretability tools like InterpretML to provide insights into how AI models make decisions. This can help build trust with users and stakeholders by making the system\\'s behavior more understandable (Source: Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements-3.pdf).\\n\\n- **Example 2: Human-Centric Design**: Follow human-AI interaction guidelines to design systems that are intuitive and user-friendly. For instance, ensure that AI systems provide clear feedback and allow users to correct errors when necessary (Source: Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements-3.pdf).\\n\\n- **Example 3: Realistic Testing**: Conduct evaluations in realistic contexts to identify potential issues before deployment. For example, if you\\'re developing an AI system for healthcare, test it in clinical settings to ensure it performs reliably under real-world conditions (Source: Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements-3.pdf).\\n\\nBy following these steps and incorporating these best practices, your organization can build and deploy AI systems responsibly while addressing ethical, societal, and technical challenges.'}\n",
